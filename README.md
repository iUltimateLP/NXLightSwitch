    ðŸŽ® A Nintendo Switch Homebrew Application to automatically switch the color scheme â˜€ðŸŒ‘
</p>

# What is it?
 + Changes the Switch's color theme based on the time of day
 + Manually set the light and dark theme times
 + Needs Homebrew (CFW) installed on your Switch

# Installing
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/iUltimateLP/NXLightSwitch/releases) and extract the .zip archive to the root of your SD card. You can also drag the files to your Switch via [ftpd](https://github.com/mtheall/ftpd). 

NXLightSwitch was tested working on [AtmosphÃ¨re](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) 0.10.4, but should work above/below, if you know what you're doing.

# Building
Compiling this project requires a [Nintendo Switch Homebrew dev environment](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment) to be installed. After that, clone this repo and run `make all` in the root of this repo. You will find all compiled files in the `out/` folder.
